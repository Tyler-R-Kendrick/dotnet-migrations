# Migrating from System.Transactions to Sagas

## Overview

As applications evolve, the need for more flexible and distributed transaction management often arises. Although `System.Transactions` and `TransactionScope` are suitable for traditional ACID transactions, they have limitations in distributed systems. Sagas provide a way to manage long-running and distributed transactions, offering increased flexibility.

## Decision Tree for Migration

- Is the application using `TransactionScope` for simple, short-lived transactions?
  - Yes: You may not need Sagas. Evaluate the limitations you're facing with `TransactionScope`.
  - No: Consider migrating to Sagas for more complex, long-running, or distributed transactions.

### Before Migration: Understanding System.Transactions Usage

Typically, in a .NET application, `System.Transactions` is used with the `TransactionScope` class to define a block of code participating in a transaction.

#### Example of System.Transactions

```csharp
using (TransactionScope scope = new TransactionScope())
{
    /* Perform transactional work here */
    SomeDatabaseOperation();
    AnotherDatabaseOperation();

    scope.Complete();
}
```

### After Migration: Utilizing Sagas

Sagas are often implemented using frameworks like MassTransit, NServiceBus, or custom-built orchestration. Below is a simplified example using a hypothetical Saga framework.

#### Example Saga Implementation

```csharp
public class OrderProcessingSaga : Saga
{
    public async Task Handle(OrderCreatedEvent e, SagaContext context)
    {
        /* Perform first transactional operation */
        await SomeDatabaseOperationAsync();
        
        // Transition to the next step
        await context.TransitionTo(OrderPendingState, e.OrderId);
    }

    public async Task Handle(OrderPendingEvent e, SagaContext context)
    {
        /* Perform next transactional operation */
        await AnotherDatabaseOperationAsync();

        // Complete the Saga
        await context.Complete();
    }
}
```

## Steps for Migrating

1. **Identify Transaction Boundaries**: Recognize areas in your application where transactions occur. These will be your Saga states.
2. **Model Saga States**: Create state classes that represent different steps in the Saga.
3. **Create Saga Handlers**: Implement handlers for each Saga state transition.
4. **Update Application Code**: Replace existing `TransactionScope` code blocks with calls to start or advance the Saga.
5. **Test**: Run your test suite and perform manual testing to ensure that transactions are working as expected in the new architecture.

## Known Issues and Gotchas

- **Idempotency**: Sagas don't automatically make operations idempotent. You must handle this in your code.
- **Error Handling**: Sagas involve complex error-handling scenarios, including compensating transactions for rollback.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Sagas often involve eventually consistent transactions, which may be a change if you're accustomed to ACID transactions.
